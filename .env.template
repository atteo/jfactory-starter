# Required parameters
####

# Main URL where the application will be accessible, without trailing '/'.
# Must be set to the IP address of the host docker machine.
# To generate some valid address execute: hostname -I | awk '{print "https://" $1 }'
# Cannot be set to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, because those addresses will point to address inside containers.

####
# Optional parameters
####

# The user is authenticated using standard BasicAuth. Depending on the value of auth.gitBasicAuthPolicy, credentials are validated using:
# The randomly generated HTTP password on the HTTP Password tab in the user settings page if gitBasicAuthPolicy is HTTP.
# The LDAP password if gitBasicAuthPolicy is LDAP
# Both, the HTTP and the LDAP passwords (in this order) if gitBasicAuthPolicy is HTTP_LDAP.
# When gitBasicAuthPolicy is not LDAP, the userâ€™s HTTP credentials can be regenerated by going to Settings, and then accessing the HTTP Password tab. Revocation can effectively be done by regenerating the password and then forgetting it.
# For Gerrit installations where an HTTP password URL is configured, the password can be obtained by clicking on Obtain Password and then following the site-specific instructions. On sites where this URL is not configured, the password can be obtained by clicking on Generate Password.
